 > Getting information off the Internet is like taking a drink from a fire hydrant.” — Mitchell Kapor
 
Welcome to Artifishell! I decided to create Arifishell in order to share my thoughts and opinions as well as post information about technologies that I find interesting. My goal is simple: present complex - or hard-to-understand - topics in a simple and intuitive way. It is my hope that people will be motivated to learn more about and research the topics and ideas on this website.

Artifishell's centered around:

- Machine/Deep Learning
- Artificial Intelligence
- Algorithms
- Data Structures
- Tech & more!
 
There may also be personal posts sprinkled throughout the site.

Please feel free to let me know about any interesting topics, ideas or projects that you'd like to see a post or article about.
