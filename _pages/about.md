## Content Creator

Hello, my name is Nicholas Guan. I decided to create Arifishell mainly in order to share my thoughts and opinions as well as post information about technologies that I find interesting. It is my hope that people will be motivated to learn more and potentially research about the topics and ideas that I discuss. I'm a computer science major and a former intern at Facebook and IBM, with 7+ years of programming experience and a background in machine learning. If you'd like to contact me, feel free to do so by messaging me on any of the platforms below :).
